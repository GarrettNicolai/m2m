Many-to-Many alignment model (m2m-aligner)

m2m-aligner is implemented by Sittichai Jiampojamarn during the PhD's years at the department of Computing Science, University of Alberta. 
This algorithm has been applied in letter-to-phoneme conversion, name transliteration and other tasks; 
for example, please see the below list of known publications that utilized the m2m-aligner.
In general, this algorithm creates lexicon alignments without requiring annotated data nor linguistic knowledge.
Its principle algorithm is based on the Ristad and Yianilos (1998) stochastic transducer described in:

@Article{RYsed98,
  author  =  {Eric Sven Ristad and Peter N. Yianilos},
  title   =  {Learning String Edit Distance},
  journal =  {IEEE Transactions on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence},

  volume  =  20,
  number  =  5,
  pages   =  {522--532},
  month   =  {May}
}

Tarek Sherif originally proposed this algorithm as a part of his Mater thesis graduated in 2007 from University of Alberta. 
I later reimplemented this algorithm to the first version of m2m-aligner based on the paper we published together at 
NAACL 2007. Since then, many refinements, improvements, and features have been included for later tasks.

VERSIONS: 

 1.0 : The first version of m2m-aligner released to public. 
 All previous versions were for in-house users available upon request in the past.

INSTALL: 

m2m-aligner has been tested on Linux systems with gcc version 4.1.2. It should be compatible with other versions, and c++ compilers. 
By default, the makefile is "makefile.default". It should be compiled by the "make" command: 

$ make 

For a faster m2m-aligner, you can change "makefile" to "makefile.stlport" which uses the stlport library instead of the default one. 
You can obtain the stlport library from http://www.stlport.org/
Then, specify the stlport path in the makefile file.  
The major difference is in the use of <map> and <hash_map> data structures. 
You may also use <hash_map> implemented as in gcc and others. The interface should be the same but I haven't tested on them yet.

File formats: 
	m2m-aligner takes two input formats so called "l2p" and "news".
	
	news format: each token separated by a space, 
	             a tab (\t) separates between source x and target y
		         one line per (x,y) pair.

	l2p format : each character byte is a toke,
	             white space(s) separates between source x and target y
				 one line per (x,y) pair.
	
	Please see an example file "toAlignEx". 
This example file is a small part of randomly taken around 1k words from the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary --
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

Example run:

	$ ./m2m-aligner --delX --maxX 2 --maxY 2 -i toAlignEx
	
	--delX : allow deletion in the source side.
	--maxX <value> : the maximum size of sub-alignments in the source side.
	--maxY <value> : the maximum size of sub-alignments in the target side.
	-i <inputfile> : unaligned lexical file to train a model
	
Example outputs: 

toAlignEx.m-mAlign.2-2.1-best.conYX.align
	alignment output file of "toAlignEx":
		Each token's separated by ":", each sub-alignment's separated by "|", a tab (\t) separates between aligned x and y.

toAlignEx.m-mAlign.2-2.1-best.conYX.align.err
	contains those examples from "toAlignEx" that can't be aligned with the current model.

toAlignEx.m-mAlign.2-2.1-best.conYX.align.model
	aligner's model file.
